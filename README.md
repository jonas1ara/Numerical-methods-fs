# Methods

## Calculus:

### [Bisection Method](https://github.com/jonas1ara/Numerical-methods-fs/tree/main/src/Bisection-method)

- Another technique to find roots of equations, especially useful when working with continuous functions on closed intervals.

### [Newton-Raphson Method](https://github.com/jonas1ara/Numerical-methods-fs/tree/main/src/Newton-Raphson-method)

- Used to find roots of nonlinear equations. It is a popular technique for solving optimization problems.

### [Numerical differentiation](https://github.com/jonas1ara/Numerical-methods-fs/tree/main/src/Numerical-differentiation)

- Numerical differentiation is a technique used to approximate the derivative of a function at a specific point by employing finite differences. 

### [Numerical integration (Rectangle rule)](https://github.com/jonas1ara/Numerical-methods-fs/tree/main/src/Numerical-integration-rectangle-rule)

- The rectangle rule is the simplest method of approximating the value of a definite integral. It approximates the region under the graph of the function `f(x)` as a single rectangle.

### [Numerical integration (Trapezoidal rule)](https://github.com/jonas1ara/Numerical-methods-fs/tree/main/src/Numerical-integration-trapezoidal-rule)

- The trapezoidal rule is a technique for approximating the definite integral. It approximates the region under the graph of the function `f(x)` as a trapezoid and calculating its area.

### [Numerical integration (Simpson's rule)](https://github.com/jonas1ara/Numerical-methods-fs/tree/main/src/Numerical-integration-simpson-rule)

- Simpson's rule is a technique for approximating the definite integral. It approximates the region under the graph of the function `f(x)` as a series of parabolic curves and calculating their areas.

## Linear algebra:

### [Jacobi Method](https://github.com/jonas1ara/Numerical-methods-fs/tree/main/src/Jacobi-method) 

- Iterative methods for solving systems of linear equations.

### [Gauss-Seidel Method](https://github.com/jonas1ara/Numerical-methods-fs/tree/main/src/Gauss-seidel-method)

- Iterative methods for solving systems of linear equations.

### [Gaussian Elimination](https://github.com/jonas1ara/Numerical-methods-fs/tree/main/src/Gaussian-elimination)

- Used to solve systems of linear equations, especially useful for large matrices.

### [LU Decomposition](https://github.com/jonas1ara/Numerical-methods-fs/tree/main/src/LU-decomposition)

- Used to solve systems of linear equations, especially useful for large matrices.

## Differential equations:

### [Euler's Method](https://github.com/jonas1ara/Numerical-methods-fs/tree/main/src/Euler-Method)

- Used to solve ordinary differential equations, which model changes in variables over time.

### [Runge-Kutta Method](https://github.com/jonas1ara/Numerical-methods-fs/tree/main/src/Runge-kutta-method)

- A family of methods for solving ordinary differential equations and systems of differential equations.

## Probability and statistics:

### [Linear interpolation]()

- Techniques to estimate intermediate values between known data points (interpolation) or to fit a curve to a dataset (regression).

### [Linear regression]() 

- Techniques to estimate intermediate values between known data points (interpolation) or to fit a curve to a dataset (regression).

### [Monte Carlo Method for integration]()

- A statistical-numerical approach for simulation and problem-solving through the generation of random numbers for integration. Monte Carlo integration is a technique for approximating the definite integral. It approximates the region under the graph of the function `f(x)` as a series of random points and calculating their areas.


### [Monte Carlo Method for calculate PI]()

- A statistical-numerical approach for simulation and problem-solving through the generation of random numbers for approximating the value of Ï€.

## Optimization:

### [Fourier Transform]()

- Used to transform signals between the time domain and the frequency domain, essential in signal processing and dynamic systems analysis.

### [Gradient descent]()

- Gradient descent to find minima or maxima of functions.
