_Fsharp makes it easy to use numerical methods even for Van Gogh_

## Methods

### [x] Bisection Method

- Another technique to find roots of equations, especially useful when working with continuous functions on closed intervals.

### [x] Newton-Raphson Method

- Used to find roots of nonlinear equations. It is a popular technique for solving optimization problems.

### [x] Numerical differentation

- Numerical differentiation is a technique used to approximate the derivative of a function at a specific point by employing finite differences. 

### [x] Numerical integration (Rectangle rule)

- The rectangle rule is the simplest method of approximating the value of a definite integral. It approximates the region under the graph of the function `f(x)` as a single rectangle.

### [x] Numerical integration (Trapezoidal rule)

- The trapezoidal rule is a technique for approximating the definite integral. It approximates the region under the graph of the function `f(x)` as a trapezoid and calculating its area.

### [x] Numerical integration (Simpson's rule)

- Simpson's rule is a technique for approximating the definite integral. It approximates the region under the graph of the function `f(x)` as a series of parabolic curves and calculating their areas.

### [x] Numerical integration (Monte Carlo)

- Monte Carlo integration is a technique for approximating the definite integral. It approximates the region under the graph of the function `f(x)` as a series of random points and calculating their areas.

### [x] Jacobi Method 

- Iterative methods for solving systems of linear equations.

### [x] Gauss-Seidel Method

- Iterative methods for solving systems of linear equations.

### [x] Gaussian Elimination

- Used to solve systems of linear equations, especially useful for large matrices.

### [x] LU Decomposition

- Used to solve systems of linear equations, especially useful for large matrices.

### [] Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

- Used in linear algebra to factorize matrices into products of simple matrices and is fundamental in techniques like dimensionality reduction.

### [] Euler's Method

- Used to solve ordinary differential equations, which model changes in variables over time.

### [] Runge-Kutta Methods

- A family of methods for solving ordinary differential equations and systems of differential equations.

### [] Interpolation and Regression

- Techniques to estimate intermediate values between known data points (interpolation) or to fit a curve to a dataset (regression).

### [] Monte Carlo Method

- A statistical-numerical approach for simulation and problem-solving through the generation of random numbers.

### [] Fourier Transform

- Used to transform signals between the time domain and the frequency domain, essential in signal processing and dynamic systems analysis.

### [] Finite Element Method

- Used to solve engineering and physics problems, especially for structural and thermal analysis.

### [] Optimization Methods

- Include techniques like gradient descent to find minima or maxima of functions.
